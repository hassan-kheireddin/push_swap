## About the Project

The **so_long** project involves creating a small 2D game where the player navigates a character through a map, collecting items and reaching an exit while avoiding obstacles. The game uses the **MiniLibX** library for rendering graphics and handling events.

This project enhances skills in:
- Graphics rendering and window management.
- Game mechanics like player movement, collision detection, and map parsing.
- Handling user inputs and keyboard events.

## Features

- **2D Rendering:** Uses the MiniLibX library to render game graphics.
- **Keyboard Input:** Supports WASD keys for movement.
- **Collectibles and Exit:** The player must collect all items to unlock the exit.
- **Dynamic Map Parsing:** Reads maps from `.ber` files and validates them.
- **Simple Game Logic:** Implements game over and success states.
